    `<B> Step 2 </ b>
🍎 Fruits and Vegetables 🌽 grow and sell for dollars and 💵 💰 Gold. 
🥚 products are extracted with 🏫 Buildings with animals, and they can be sold for Euro 💶 and 💎 Diamond. 
For 💵 dollars you can buy 🌱 plants for planting, and for 💶 Euro - build 🏫 Buildings for animals.
Gold and Diamond can be exchanged for real money.
<Code> To date, the exchange rate is as follows: 
100 Gold = $ 1.
100 Diamond = 0.0002 BTC. </ Code>
